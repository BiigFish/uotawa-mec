Unfortunately, there are many people who cannot access the medical equipment they need. MERCI is a student-led initiative that collects medical equipment donations from the community and redistributes them to those in need. Our donations usually come from generous people in the community and healthcare facilities with surplus equipment. Through the help of partnerships with OTs, and other charities, we then help connect these items to suitable clients that might not otherwise be able to access them. 

Our team started in 2016 as a student club of uOttawa called the MEC foundation. Today, we are registered as a non-profit organization with two school chapters: uOttawa and QueensU. Our work is done by passionate student volunteers who make life changing impacts in their communities.
